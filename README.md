# C Projects
A collection of small C programs built for Windows.
Created during my C programming university course.

Included are...

* **hotel2.c**: A demo of online hotel reservation system.
* **car_rental_2.c** and **car_rental_2.h**: A demo of online car rental management system.

Included along the respective EXE file so you can try along without compiling the source.

Free to use.
